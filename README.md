### Abstract 

The time trade-off method is widely used to elicit individual preferences over health states. The resulting utility values, measured on a scale anchored at full health (=1) and dead (=0), are commonly aggregated across individuals, in order to derive a social value set. In this paper, we argue that using dead, instead of the worst health state as a lower anchor is problematic, because individuals with a wider range of utility values have – simply for arithmetic reasons – more influence in the estimation of the social value set. Inspired by relative utilitarianism, we propose an alternative aggregation procedure, the 'UNPAc method', which aims to equalise individuals’ influences. We conducted a simulation study to demonstrate the potential impact of the new method on aggregate social health state values, and tested its practical feasibility in an EQ-5D 3L data set from the UK. Our findings suggest that the new relative utilitarian approach can eliminate differences in influence that are due to differences in individuals' utility ranges. However, the differences in the resulting social value may not always be considered relevant, and substantial, currently unexplained variation in individuals' influences on the social value set remain.
