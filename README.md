### Abstract 

__Background__  

  The time trade-off (TTO) method is widely used to elicit individual preferences over (EQ-5D 3L, 5L, and Y) health states. Resulting utility values, measured on a scale that is anchored at full health and dead, are commonly aggregated across individuals, in order to derive a social value set. Here, we argue that this aggregation procedure is problematic, because it fails to take into account that TTO utility values are not only determined by an individual’s preference for the quality, but also for the quantity of life. As a consequence, when health state utilities are aggregated across different individuals, individuals with a wider range of utility values have – simply for arithmetic reasons – more weight in the estimation of the social value set. Inspired by relative utilitarianism, we propose an alternative aggregation procedure, to equalise individuals’ weights in the estimation of social health state values. We apply the alternative procedure to an EQ-5D 3L data set and compare the results against the conventional social tariff.

__Methods__

  We used UK EQ-5D 3L data from the 1993 measurement and valuation of health study. As far as feasible, we replicated the main effects regression model and estimated social tariffs using the conventional and the proposed alternative utility aggregation procedure. Differences between both approaches were assessed by comparing model coefficients, as well as absolute and relative social health state values. In addition, we used linear and polynomial regression models to investigate to what extent individuals' utility ranges are associated with influence on the (relative) social tariff.

__Results__

  2,985 participants were included in the analysis. The alternative aggregation procedure yielded different results than the conventional method: The main effects model coefficients differed between 0\% and 8\%, and social values were generally higher (mean error = 0.022) in the alternative tariff, and 156 (64.2\%) health states had a different (relative) rank. For the conventional method, we found a strong, non-linear relationship between an individuals' utility ranges and their influence on the (relative) social value set (R2=0.18), while for the alternative method, the relationship was much weaker (R2=0.04).

__Conclusion__

  The conventional TTO preference aggregation procedure gives individuals with a wider range of utility values systematically more weight in the estimation of the EQ-5D 3L social tariff. The proposed alternative method can resolve this issue and provides significantly different social health state values.
